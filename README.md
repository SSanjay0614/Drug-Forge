# Drug Forge: AI/ML-Driven Drug Discovery Platform

## Problem Statement
Drug discovery is a long and expensive process, involving many trial-and-error experiments to assess the properties of potential drug molecules. Traditional approaches require manual testing of ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties, drug-target binding, and molecular interactions, which can take years and cost billions of dollars. The lack of predictive tools adds to this challenge, making the early stages of drug development highly inefficient.

## Solution
**Drug Forge** is a machine learning-powered web platform that accelerates drug discovery by providing key insights into the properties of molecules, without the need for manual assays. Our platform enables scientists to predict crucial drug features like ADMET properties, drug-target binding scores, and activity against specific biological targets.

## Key Features:
### 1. **ADMET Property Prediction**
   - Predict Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity properties using advanced machine learning models. This helps researchers quickly evaluate whether a molecule has favorable drug-like characteristics without needing costly lab tests.

### 2. **Target Identification and Activity Prediction**
   - **Select Targets**: Choose one of the targets like **MAO-B, ACE2, COX-2, 5-HT3**, or **hERG**. These targets represent key biological molecules associated with diseases like Parkinsonâ€™s, COVID-19, inflammation, and cardiotoxicity.
   - **Activity Prediction**: Easily predict whether a molecule will be active or inactive against a chosen target.

### 3. **Drug-Target Binding Score Prediction (Molecular Docking)**
   - Predict the binding affinity between a drug molecule and its target protein. This feature provides an indication of how well a molecule might bind to its target, giving insights into its potential efficacy before in-depth biological testing.
